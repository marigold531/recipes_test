    <h1>Mofongo</h1>
    <img src="../images/mofongo.jpg">
    <p>At its most basic, mofongo is made of fried green plantains mashed with garlic and chicharrones
        (deep-fried pork skin), served with a buttery-garlic or a peppery- capsicum-tomato Creole sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 green plantains</li>
        <li>1 lb of chicharrón (crunchy pork skin)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, mashed</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups frying oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the plantains, cut them into 1 1/2-inch slices, soak them in salty water for 15 minutes, 
            drain them and dry them before putting them on the hot skillet with oil.</li>
        <li>Fry them for about 12 minutes at medium-low heat or until they turn light brown.
            Make sure to turn them. Do not brown them too much, so they are easy to mash.
            Stick a fork in them to check if they are done.</li>
        <li>Remove them and mash them on a mortar. Add some mashed garlic and pieces of chicharrón.</li>
        <li>Once you have mashed all the plantains, mold them into the shape of half sphere using your hands or a container. 
            Serve hot with chicken broth or your favorite meat.</li>
    </ol>
